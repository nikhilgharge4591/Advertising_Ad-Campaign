Advertising Ad Campaign Machine Learning Problem

The task is to predict who will most likely click on the ad. Let's consider that we are working for a marketing company. Firstly, we have to understand what constitutes a profit and a loss.

Let's assume that you have a marketing campaign for which we spend 1000USD per potential customer. For each customer that we target with our ad campaign and that clicks on the ad, we get an overall profit of 100USD. However, if we target a customer that ends up not clicking on the ad, we incur a net loss of 1050USD. Therefore we can conclude that for each customer that was not targeted by the campaign and who clicks on the ad, we get an overall profit of 1100USD. Unfortunately, we have no information about the advertized product; this information could have guided us through our understanding of the user behavior.
